# CSE 101 Programming Assignment 6: BigInteger ADT

## Files included:
    1. Arithmetic.cpp
        - Client file that contains main function, and calls function from BigInt ADT.
    2. BigInteger.cpp
        - Implementation file for BigInteger ADT.
    3. BigInteger.h
        - Header file for BigInteger ADT.
    4. BigIntegerTest.cpp
        - Test harness that contain main function for running my own tests, and debugging.
    5. List.cpp
        - List ADT implemenation file.
    6. List.h
        - List ADT header file.
    7. ListTest.cpp
        - List ADT test harness that contains main function written by me to test ADT out and debug.
    8. Makefile
        - Makefile provided on CSE 101 website that compiles and builds an executable for various BigInteger files.
    9. READEME
        - The following document, written in MarkDown formatting.

### Notes:
    I worked on this for a long time, and have not been able to figure out mult() completely. I ended up writing Arithmetic.cpp even though I know I likely won't
    get many points on it, since mult() isn't working, but all of my other functions work and pass my own tests as well as the grading script.
