# Programming Assignment 1: Lexographical Sort using a doubly linked list

## Files

1. ```List.h```
    - Header file for List ADT, and contains function prototypes.
2. ```List.c```
    - Implementation file for List ADT. Builds a doubly linked list
    using functions declared in ```List.h```
3. ```ListTest.c```
    - Contains main function written by me to test and manipulate List ADT. Tests each and every
    function from ```List.h```
4. ```Lex.c```
    - File contains main function, where File I/O is done, and a lexographical sort
    of strings from an input file is done by manipulating the List ADT.
5. ```Makefile```
    - File contains commands neccessary to "make" or build the program and compile it. For more info
    on what commands to use, view the makefile and read comments at top.
6. ```README.md```
    - My README file that's been completed using Markdown for better viewing on GitLab.
